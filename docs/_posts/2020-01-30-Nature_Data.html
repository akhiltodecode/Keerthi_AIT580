<h2 class="section-heading">Who collected the Data</h2>

<p>The data is published by the US Department of Education where it created a university scorecard to provide reliable and impartial information about university performance. The Ministry of Education works with a variety of national agencies along with the inclusion of a loan repayment program for student debt</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why did they collect the data?</h2>
<p>Under President Barack Obama's administration, the College Scorecard dataset was created in 2013 to make college data more accessible to consumers through a centralized, interactive tool. The purpose of publishing these files was to provide the students with sufficient data to make informed decisions when choosing a university. It also served the purpose of improving the clarifications on various queries.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Given the nature of the data, how can you adjust and leverage the data?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of valuable information available in the College Scorecard dataset. There are around 3000 variables in the Most_Recent_Cohort_Institution.csv file. Some key facts like the collegeâ€™s cumulative admission rate for the previous years, passing and failure accuracy rate for subjects are not considered. For the scope of this project, we have divided the dataset into different metrics to get better understanding of the dataset and to get valuable insights.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Is there any privacy, quality, or other issues with this data?</h2>
<br>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>There are no privacy issues with this data since all personal information of students and financial details are compressed and deleted before making this data accessible in a centralized, interactive tool. </p>
<br>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>
 Pros: While a college's website may advertise a high sticker price, the College Scorecard shows the school's average annual cost, which includes tuition, living costs, books, and fees minus the average grants and scholarships for federal financial aid recipients. This is also referred to as the net price.
  Cons: Because the Scorecard provides median data and ranges on a variety of metrics, results should not be expected to be the same for everyone. Students should be cautious when comparing median wages at one school to those at another, especially if the samples represented by the two schools are significantly different.
