<h2 class="section-heading">Who collected the Data</h2>

<p>The data is published by the US Department of Education where it created a university scorecard to provide reliable and impartial information about university performance. The Ministry of Education works with a variety of national agencies along with the inclusion of a loan repayment program for student debt</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why did they collect the data?</h2>
<p>The feature of publishing these files was to provide the students with sufficient data to make informed decisions when choosing a university. It also served the purpose of improving the clarifications on various queries.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">What is the nature of the data given the purpose of the data collection?</h2>
<p>The data is publicly available and is intended for students planning higher education. We covered all aspects related to admission rate, for the graduate students to the
PELL Grants.

<h2 class="section-heading">Given the nature of the data, how can you adjust and leverage the data?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of valuable information allocated in the Government Website. Some key facts like the collegeâ€™s cumulative admission rate for the previous years, passing and failure accuracy rate for subjects are not considered</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Is there any privacy, quality, or other issues with this data?</h2>
<br>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>All the data provided on the website is for the purpose of choice making and there is no major objection or flaw in the privacy of data, as such, it can be made an open - source. Only the information on the loan allotment for the students is debateable.</p>
<br>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Although the data is considered for each year like 2020-2021, there is not many cumulative collections/comparisons of the data as in the admission rate or cumulative salaries etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>Other Data Issues </h3>
<p>Few data points are evaluated as average values, hence, does not provide the independent values</p>
