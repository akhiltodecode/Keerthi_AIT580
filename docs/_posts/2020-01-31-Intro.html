<p>The major concern for the students attending a college is to decide on various aspects like the college rankings, fees structure etc to match a dream college. As a reference for all the challenges, the US government has designed the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">datarecords</a> about colleges</p>
<p>To assist you in making the best decision when enrolling in college, various visualizations are created that take into account student admission rates, retention rates, median salaries, and fee structures.  </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Main-focus</h2>
<p>Tuition Fee for in-state and out-state students across Public, Private Non-Profit and Private For-Profit schools and Top 20 schools with median salaries of students after 6 and 10 years of entry</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Target Audience</h2>
<p>With this analysis in place, high school students, current undergraduate students and parents can make decisions about which school to attend</p>
