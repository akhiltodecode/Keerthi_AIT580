<h2 class="section-heading">Results from School Metrics</h2>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v1-3.png" alt="School Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Distribution of type of schools</span>
<p>From the above plot, we can notice that public schools are more in number than private schools</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v1-1.png" alt="School Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Geographical representation of tution fee is schools</span>
<p>The above graphs represents the average tuition fee for in-state students in all universities in a state. The red color states Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island are having higest average in-state tuition fee,
  whereas the states in purple color represent the lowest average in-state tuition fee.
</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v1-2.png" alt="School Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Geographical representation of tution fee is schools</span>
<p>The above graphs represents the average tuition fee for out-of-state students in all universities in a state. The orange color states Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut and Rhode Island are having higest average out-of-state tuition fee,
  whereas the states in blue color represent the lowest average out-of-state tuition fee.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v2-1-1.png" alt="Student Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Distribution of students retention rate</span>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v2-1-2.png" alt="Student Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Distribution of students retention rate</span>

<p>The above distribution represents that the students who enrolled full-time in a school are having high retention rate than the students who enrolled part-time </p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v2-2.png" alt="Student Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Distribution of students completion rate</span>

<p>The students who enrolled full-time in a school have 50% probability to complete the degree.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v2-3.png" alt="School Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Distribution of schools by state</span>

<p>From the above result, we can notice that the California state has highest number of public and proprietary schools and New York has highest number of private non-profit schools</p>


<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v3-2.png" alt="Admission Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Boxplot of Admission Rate</span>

<p>From the above plot, we can notice that around 75% of students get accepted into post secondary schools</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v3-3.png" alt="Admission Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Table of Admission Rate</span>

<p>From the above result, public schools have high admission rate and they require average ACT and SAT scores 23.07 and 1124.5 respectively.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v4-1.png" alt="Earning Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Tree Map of schools with mean salary of students after 10 years of entry</span>

<p>From the above graph, we can notice that students who studied in Franklin W Olin College of Engineering can earn more in 10 years</p>

<p>Another representation of the same graph</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v4-3.png" alt="Earning Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Bar graph of schools with mean salary of students after 10 years of entry</span>

<p>Another representation with 6 years after entry, from this plot we can notice that students from CalTech earn more in 6 years. It is observed that we can get more accuracy when we consider 10 years after entry to predict their success.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v4-3.png" alt="Earning Metrics">
<span class="caption text-muted">Bar graph of schools with mean salary of students after 10 years of entry</span>

<p>We tried fitting linear regression model to the dataset with Mean salary after 10 years entry as response variable and other variables as predictors. Below is the summary of the model</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/v5-1.png" alt="analysis">
<span class="caption text-muted">Fitted linear regression model on mean salary of students after 10 years of entry</span>
<p>From the above result, we can notice that the adjusted R-squared is 60% and the following variables are considered significant with the response variable: cost of attendance, median debt of students after graduation, ACT cummulative score, tution fees and students with federal loan</p>

<p>Similarly, we tried to fit linear regression model with mean salary of students after 6 years of entry</p>
