My undergraduation was in Computer Science Engineering and now headed for a Masters degree in Data Analytics Engineering.

Earlier at my job, having worked on QA Python Automation on Servers Technology which had lots of data, has driven me to deep dive into data and built my interests to learn its techniques of data-mining, analysis, visualization, optimization, Hadoop Analysis and other.Taking this course will help me to adapt these problem solving skills at Big-Data.

Learning Tools like R, Tableau, Querying data, Machine Learning techniques will help me in becoming a proficient Data Analyst / Data Scientist.

Curious & Looking forward to this course. 

Computing Environments worked on are Python Automation, RobotFramework, Selenium, Jira, HPE Server Tools/ Share Point, Rest APIs, Git-hub.
