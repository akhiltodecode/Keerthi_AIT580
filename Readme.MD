Hope you are doing good!, I'm Akhilesh Keerthi 

My undergraduation was in Computer Science Engineering and then a Masters degree in Data Analytics Engineering.

Earlier at my job, having worked on QServers Technology which had lots of data, has driven me to deep dive into data and built my interests to learn its techniques of data-mining, analysis, visualization, optimization, Hadoop Analysis and other.Taking this course will help me to adapt these problem solving skills at Big-Data.

Leveraging in Tools like R, Python, Tableau, Querying data, Machine Learning techniques will help me in becoming a proficient Data Analyst / Data Scientist.

Curious & Looking forward



Happy Learning :)
